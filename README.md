# CBOSLib
This C library provides type-safe veneers to miscellaneous OS-specific functionality not provided by the Wimp and Toolbox libraries supplied with Acorn C/C++. It should have minimal dependencies on other libraries and must not include any code or interfaces that could be useful on other platforms. It should not dynamically allocate memory.
